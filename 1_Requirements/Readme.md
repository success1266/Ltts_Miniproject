# Research
I sought for basic quiz application interfaces that were already available for this project. Then I attempted to locate the technological items that I would require in order to complete this operation. I performed some research into how to optimise and clean up the code. These articles and materials were really beneficial to me throughout my initial period, i.e.
1.  https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/cpp/gcc_make.html

# SWOT ANALYSIS
SWOT analysis is a strategic planning tool that evaluates a project's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. It entails defining the project's goal and determining which internal and external factors are favourable and unfavourable to accomplishing that goal. The strengths and weaknesses usually arise from within an organisation, and the opportunities and threats from external sources.
